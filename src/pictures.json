    "explanation": "Do all galaxies have black holes at their centers?  Although not even a single galaxy has yet been proven to have a central black hole, the list of candidates continues to increase.  Results by astronomers using instruments like the Hubble Space Telescope now indicate that most - and possibly even all - large galaxies may harbor one of these dense beasts. In all the galaxies studied, star speeds continue to increase closer the very center. This in itself indicates a center millions of times more massive than our Sun is needed to contain the stars.  This mass when combined with the limiting size make the case for the central black holes.  Will we ever know for sure?",

    "explanation": "What does Mars look like from here? Last September, before hiking across rugged and slippery terrain to reach its winter hibernation point, the robotic Spirit rover climbed a small plateau known as Home Plate and captured the spectacular vista pictured above.  Part of the curious flat-topped Home Plate is visible as the light colored landscape across the panorama's foreground.   On the image left, visible about eight kilometers in the distance, is Grissom Hill, while on the left foreground is rock strewn Tsiolkovski Ridge.  On the right, at about 800 meters distant, is Husband Hill, already explored by Spirit and notable as the highest point visible in the westward looking panorama. In the inset is a close-up of a tiny motionless feature informally dubbed Little Bigfoot that has drawn some attention for it superficial appearance to a humanoid life form.  Tenacious image explorers might locate Little Bigfoot towards the front left of the high resolution panorama.  Spirit successfully reached its energy-conserving winter haven in December.",

    "explanation": "Why isn't this ant a big sphere?  Planetary nebula Mz3 is being cast off by a star similar to our Sun that is, surely, round.  Why then would the gas that is streaming away create an ant-shaped nebula that is distinctly not round?  Clues might include the high 1000-kilometer per second speed of the expelled gas, the light-year long length of the structure, and the magnetism of the star  visible above at the nebula's center.  One possible answer is that Mz3 is hiding a second, dimmer star that orbits close in to the bright star.  A competing hypothesis holds that the central star's own spin and magnetic field are channeling the gas.  Since the central star appears to be so similar to our own Sun, astronomers hope that increased understanding of the history of this giant space ant can provide useful insight into the likely future of our own Sun and Earth.",

    "explanation": "Inaugurating the era of space exploration for the US, the First Explorer was launched into Earth orbit forty years ago (February 1, 1958) by the Army Ballistic Missle Agency. The Explorer I satellite weighed about 30 pounds, was 6 feet long, 6 inches in diameter and consisted of batteries, transmitters, and scientific instrumentation built into the fourth stage of a Jupiter-C rocket. Foreshadowing NASA and the adventurous and successful Explorer Program, Explorer I bolstered national prestige in the wake of Sputnik. The satellite also contributed to a spectacular scientific bonanza - the discovery of Earth-girdling belts of magnetically trapped charged particles now known as the Van Allen Radiation Belts.",

    "explanation": "On July 4, an almost Full Moon rose in planet Earth's evening skies. Also known as a Buck Moon, the full lunar phase (full on July 3 at 11:39 UTC) was near perigee, the closest point in the Moon's almost monthly orbit around planet Earth. That qualified this July's Full Moon as a supermoon, the first of four supermoons in 2023. Seen from Cocoa Beach along Florida's Space Coast on July 4, any big, bright, beautiful Full Moon would still have to compete for attention though. July's super-moonrise was captured here against a super-colorful fireworks display.",
